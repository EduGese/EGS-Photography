# EGS-Photography

Personal Photography Portfolio created with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap during the second year of DAW.
The website uses HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap library to achieve an attractive and responsive design.

## Description
Another one of my passions is photography, and when I was assigned to create a personal portfolio for the Web Interface Design subject, I didn't hesitate. This project is a static photography portfolio designed to elegantly and effectively showcase my photographic work. The clean and minimalist structure of the site allows the images to take center stage. The use of Bootstrap ensures that the site is fully responsive, which means it will look and function well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. Only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap have been used, which was part of the assignment's requirements, so it has few functionalities.

## Demo
